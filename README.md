Building responsive UIs in React Native.

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wcandillon/react-native-responsive-ui/4637085802323386110a6352929147d11e1ca83c/example/components/images/example.gif)

An example is available via expo [here](https://expo.io/@wcandillon/react-native-responsive-ui).

## What about existing packages?

* [react-native-responsive](https://github.com/adbayb/react-native-responsive): This library provides interesting APIs but it doesn't listen to changes in the app window.
This is problematic when changing the orientation of the device or when splitting screens.

* [react-native-responsive-styles](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-responsive-styles): This is a great library but it contains a native depency which prevents you to use it with expo for instance.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-native-responsive-ui --save
```

## Usage

The `MediaQuery` component renders its children only if the query evaluates to true (see list of properties below).
This component listens to changes in the window dimensions.
In the example below, we render the `Logo` component if the window's height has a minimum size of `450dp` and if the device orientation is in portrait mode (height is larger than width).

### Media Queries

```jsx
// @flow
import React, {Component} from "react";
import {View} from "react-native";
import {MediaQuery} from "react-native-responsive-ui";

export default class Login extends Component {
    render(): React$Element<*> {
        return <View>
            <MediaQuery minHeight={450} orientation="portrait">
                <Logo />
            </MediaQuery>
        </View>;
    }
}

```

|----------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| minHeight      | dp     | Minimum height of the window.                                                        |
| maxHeight      | dp     | Maximum height of the window.                                                        |
| minWidth       | dp     | Minimum width of the window.                                                         |
| maxHeight      | dp     | Maximum height of the window.                                                        |
| minAspectRatio | number | Minimum aspect ration of the window (ratio of horizontal pixels to vertical pixels). |
| maxAspectRatio | number | Maximum aspect ration of the window (ratio of horizontal pixels to vertical pixels). |
| minPixelRatio  | number | Minimum device pixel density. See [PixelRatio](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pixelratio.html). |
| maxPixelRatio  | number | Maximum device pixel density. See [PixelRatio](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pixelratio.html). |
| orientation    | `portrait` or `landspace` | Indicates whether the viewport is in landscape (the display is wider than it is tall) or portrait (the display is square or taller than it is wide) mode. |
| platform       | string | Platform of the device.  See [Platform](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/platform-specific-code.html#platform-module). |
| condition      | boolean | Abritrary boolean value that must be true for the media query to pass. |


### ResponsiveComponent

`ResponsiveComponents` extends `React.Component` and add the window dimensions to the state of the component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {ResponsiveComponent} from "react-native-responsive-ui";

export default class Debug extends ResponsiveComponent {
    render() {
        const {width, height} = this.state.window;
        console.log(`New window dimensions: ${width}x${height}`);
        return null;
    }
}
```

### withWindow

`withWindow` is a higher order component that will wrap your component and provide the window dimensions as props.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {withWindow} from "react-native-responsive-ui";

class Debug extends React.Component {
    render() {
        const {width, height} = this.props.window;
        console.log(`New window dimensions: ${width}x${height}`);
        return null;
    }
}

export default withWindow(Debug);
```

### ResponsiveStyleSheet

`ResponsiveStyleSheet` returns a stylesheet given multiple media queries.
Unlike `Stylesheet` from React Native, you need to invoke this method from the `render()` method since it will be invoked for each dimension change.
In order to re-render the component for each dimension change, you need to extends `ResponsiveComponent`.
See example below.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {ResponsiveComponent, ResponsiveStyleSheet} from "react-native-responsive-ui";

export default class Buttons extends ResponsiveComponent {
    render() {
        const {style} = this;
        return <View style={style.btns}>
            <Button label="Login" primary style={style.btn} />
            <Button label="Sign Up" style={style.btn} />
        </View>;
    }
    
    get style() {
        return ResponsiveStyleSheet.select([
        {
            query: { orientation: "landscape" },
            style: {
                btns: {
                    flexDirection: "row"
                },
                btn: {
                    flex: 1
                }
            }
        },
        {
            query: { orientation: "portrait" },
            style: {
                btns: {
                    alignSelf: "stretch"
                },
                btn: {
                    flex: 0
                }
            }
        }
        ]);
    }
}
```

### MediaQuerySelector

`MediaQuerySelector` evaluates a media query and return true or false.
See example below.

```jsx
import {Device, MediaQuerySelector} from "react-native-responsive-ui";

const {width, height} = Device.dimensions.window;
MediaQuerySelector.query({ orientation: "portrait", minHeight: 450 }, width, height)
```
